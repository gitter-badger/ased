create the two databases in this folder and import the tables

password and username for the wordpress db can be found in wp-config.php

password and username for the skills network db can be found in register-skills/register_user.php or skills-network/index.php

either use the passwords and usernames in those files when you create users for the dbs or if you have created new users for the dbs remember to change credentials in these files too.
